Display some "techno babble" at the top of your administration screen.

== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words - Star Trek.

This plugin, ripping off Matt Mullenweg's own Hello Dolly, will add a random line to the top of your administration page. But, instead of a line from a song from a barely remembered musical, this will be an item of randomly generated Star Trek-style techno babble, with possibly millions of different combinations possible.

Yes, you too can create some really impressive, scientifically baseless (yet still entertaining) techno-babble. It's useless! It's fun! It's not official endorced by Paramount!
